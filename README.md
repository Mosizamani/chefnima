# Chef Nima

Per the English proverb, "eyes are the windows to the soul"; in the same line, we can attest that Persian cuisine acts as a gateway to the caring, 
            sensual soul and often the poetic heart of our people. We invite you to experience this gastronomic poetry in motion, revelled in rosewater, 
            saffron, and our natural jewel, pomegranate. Lyricism, culture, and satisfaction of the senses in each spoon. What else?"




## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
